# Selfie Background Removal: Project Overview
**Created an app that automatically removes the background from a selfie image.**

## App:

You can try it at:

https://share.streamlit.io/javiergarciamolina/selfie-background-removal/main/background-removal-app.py


Please take into account that the model was trained on mid-upper body selfies, with only one person in the picture and relatively near from the camera.

## Steps:

* Downloaded the AISegment.com Matting Human dataset, which consists of approximately 34 thousand pictures of mid-upper body selfies and their respective masks.
* Tried a couple U-net-like architectures and selected the best, achieving a 0.994 IoU on the test set.
* Built an algorithm that corrects the orientation of the image.
* Built a web app using Streamlit so that anyone can use the model to remove the background from their selfies.

## Main technologies used:

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Main techniques used:

* Deep Learning
* Modern Computer Vision
* Data Augmentation
* Image Segmentation

## Visualizing the data:

I used the AISegment.com Matting Human dataset, which consists of approximately 34 thousand pictures and masks of mid-upper body selfies, with only one person in each picture, relatively near from the camera and with a high contrast with the background.

Let's see one image along with its provided label:

## Model Selection:

Original U-net architecture:

I built and tested three U-net-like architectures, **achieving an IoU of 0.994 on the test set** with the last one.

## [Correcting the orientation:](https://github.com/javiergarciamolina/selfie-background-removal/blob/main/correct_image_orientation.ipynb)

After deploying the web app, I saw that sometimes the server would randomly rotate the image, which lead to bad results.

**So I built a deep learning model that would tell whether an image is correctly oriented, and an algorithm that would rotate it to its correct orientation.**

## Visualizing some results:

Let's see some examples of test images plotted against their ground-truth (or at least the one provided in the dataset) and their predictions:

## How could we improve this algorithm?

* **Getting different kinds of pictures (not only mid-upper body selfies).**
* Getting more and better labelled data.
* After getting more data, training more complex models and using ensemble-learning.
